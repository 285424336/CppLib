For some of them is a wrap of other open source code, so if it has hurt your interests, please contact me.

It is not a complete project, only include the lib src codes, and examples. You can look at the <lib name>/doc for more information of the lib, and <lib name>/doc/sample for the sample code of the lib.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
